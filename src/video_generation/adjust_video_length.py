    Adjusts the length of a video clip to the specified target length.

    :param input_video: The path to the input video file.

    The `adjust_video_length` method adjusts the length of an input video clip to the specified target length. It uses the `VideoFileClip` class from the moviepy library to load the video clip.

    The original duration of the video clip is obtained using the `duration` property of the `video_clip` object. The desired duration is calculated by adding 3 seconds to the target length.

    The speed factor is then calculated by dividing the original duration by the desired duration.

    Using the `speedx` method from the `vfx` module of the moviepy library, the playback speed of the video clip is changed by applying the speed factor.

    Finally, the adjusted video clip is written to the output video file using the `write_videofile` method, specifying the codec as "libx264".

    Note: This method requires the moviepy library to be installed.
