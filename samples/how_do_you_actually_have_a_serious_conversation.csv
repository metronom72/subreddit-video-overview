tuffspark_,332,I honestly just stopped hanging out with them cause they were too exhausting,0
CaliNVJ,136,"This. I dropped a 30 plus year friend because if this. I just could not take it anymore. I have no idea why I did it that long. It was not just talking over me, it was going on and on about the same 5 subjects for years. Energy vampires. Ditch them.
I wish you the best of luck. Likely the family member is a bully, does not care, and will not change. Sorry. My experience. No one matters but them.",1
CaliNVJ,55,"Energy vampire is just a common term for people who suck the life and energy out of you when you are with them. It would be a good term for OP’s talks over  them relative. When I was in situations like that in the past, I would leave exhausted. These people want to take your time and energy to be all about them, yet they do not return the time or energy, they just take it. Thus energy vampire.",2
FirstEvolutionist,46,"Ah, you've caught me at a particularly draining moment. As an energy vampire from the series ""What We Do in the Shadows,"" my essence thrives on the mundane, the tedious, and the emotionally exhausting. Unlike my flashier, blood-drinking counterparts, my sustenance comes from the everyday interactions that leave others feeling inexplicably weary and drained.

Picture this: I walk into a room and initiate an endless conversation about the most banal topics. I might recount, in excruciating detail, my latest trip to the grocery store, or perhaps I'll drown them into the finer points of corporate jargon. My presence lingers, my voice monotone, drawing the very life force from those around me. My powers are particularly potent in office environments, where meetings are my hunting grounds, and small talk is my weapon of choice.

Unlike traditional vampires, I don't need to avoid sunlight or sleep in coffins. My abilities are subtle but effective, allowing me to blend seamlessly into modern society. While my victims might not realize what's happening at first, they'll soon find themselves inexplicably tired, struggling to stay focused, and desperately seeking an escape from my conversational clutches.

You see, it's not about the blood. It's about boredom. My sustenance is their despair, their frustration, their drained patience. So, the next time you find yourself yawning uncontrollably during a particularly dull chat, beware—you might just be in the presence of an energy vampire.

There was that one time where I was draining this fellow coworker. I stopped in front of the water-cooler while he was getting some water. Stephen was his name. No, actually this was George. Stephen was the printer guy who had started just a couple of weeks before that. I shared a water-cooler convo with him as well but that's neither here nor there. You see, it's weird because why do they even hire ""printer guys"" anymore? Did this happen in the 90s? They have a 90s show now, did you know? It's like the 70s show but about the 90s. Of course the lens through which we are looking at now it's completely different...",2

BeautifulTrainWreck8,40,"If it isn’t a situation where you can just cut them out of your life like others here have suggested… Try talking through a different means. Email, text, voice chat. I have a sibling with severe ADHD and they struggle with talking over people. This is a loving and kind person that I would never cut out of my life but sometimes I do try to reach out in other ways.",0

alaenchii,19,You stop talking to them,0
inkseep1,19,"Yes, this is a problem. A conversation might be something like this:  ""I plan on mowing the yard if it does"" ""This came in the mail.""  ""I plan on mowing the yard"" ""You need to look at this thing in in the mail"".  ""I plan on mowing if it does""  ""This plant needs to be watered""  ""Eventually you will let me finish my sentence.  I plan on mowing if it does not rain and after that we can go get"" ""Can you thread my sewing machine""  ""Why can't I finish my sentence?""  ""You were making noise so I was just making noise too, that is conversation.""   

I live with a person who really thinks that conversations between people are random noises and do not mean much.  

My solution is that any information I do not get to share is something they do not get to know about or share in.  The rest of that sentence is ""we can go get ice cream"".  So when I go get it by myself and then tell them about it, they find out that they missed it because they didn't let me talk.",0

djh_van,19,"Record them.
Then the next day (wait 24 hours minimum from last contact, so everybody has had time to calm down and forget the details of the interaction), send them a copy of the recording, and explain ""Can you see why I struggle to talk with you?""",0
RachSlixi,18,"That is the worse thing about this thread.  Everyone is assuming the person is an arsehole.  No, many don't even realise.

Something that helped me is that my best friend will softly (as opposed to passive aggressively as many here think OP should) and simply says ""My turn RachSlixi"" to communicate that I'm doing it. I try very hard but I'm ADHD and I get enthusiastic.  It is a gentle reminder (she is not cranky or upset) to me that ""hey, shush"".  She doesn't do it every time but certainly if I'm having a particularly bad day or she particularly needs to say what she was going to say right now., she will.    It makes me realise I've done it and has actually helped in my overall awareness of when I'm doing it.   Not just with her  but with others.  I still do it more than I would like but I am more aware now so I'm more likely to stop myself.    She doesn't have to do it as much as she used to.

My other best mate is also ADHD and we do it to each other and it's kind of nice to have one person where we can talk over each other as much as we want and we both enjoy ourselves lol.",0

BeautifulTrainWreck8,14,Exactly. My brother actually beats himself up over it. He’s tried meds and other coping skills. Not everyone who talks over people is an asshole.,0
MinusGovernment,13,"I say ""ok I'll just let you talk"" as blatantly passive-aggresive as I can. If that doesn't work I relocate myself as needed.

Impossible__Joke,12,Just dont stop talking and finish your thought. Act like you can't even hear them. It will quickly register with them and they will stop talking,0
derkonigistnackt,11,"Yeah, every person I've met who is like that just doesn't seem able to unlearn the habit. I got a few of those in my family and I dated a girl like this once. Told them all repeatedly when they were interrupting me, or that I wasn't finished talking when something I was trying to say reminded them of something or whatever... Didn't matter. As far as I'm concerned, it's just a side effect of narcissism and they just aren't self aware enough to be able to correct it. In the end, I just avoid them because they rarely say something they haven't repeated 100 times to me already",0
