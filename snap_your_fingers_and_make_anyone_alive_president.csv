The political theorist Thomas Hobbes didn’t think a divided governmental system could work. He reasoned that over time one branch would seek to snuff out the others… that may have turned out to be true but what’s happened here is we’ve allowed parties to organize into these behemoths that seek to circumvent the system of checks and balances by controlling all branches of government at the same time.

Alexis de Tocqueville concluded that the American system worked only because the American people were committed to making it work, not because there was anything special about the government’s design. I blame the two party system for the erosion of civics in American society. 

As the Irish proverb goes: if there are 50 religions in a country they will exist together peacefully, but if there are only two religions they will tear each other to shreds.",2

TulipRemii,2534,"I'd throw in a vote for LeVar Burton. Reading Rainbow guided us as kids, maybe he can guide the nation too—with a calm demeanor and a pursuit for knowledge and empathy. Plus, imagine the State of the Union addresses ending with, ""But you don't have to take my word for it.""",0
Narcolepticparamedic,151,He has a podcast called LeVar Burton Reads which is so calming. He reads short stories (for adults) so is still guiding people through his reading.
